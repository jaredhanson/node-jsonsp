# jsonsp

[JSON](http://www.json.org/) stream parser for [Node](http://nodejs.org).

## Installation

    $ npm install jsonsp

Install from source code repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jaredhanson/node-jsonsp.git
    $ cd node-jsonsp
    $ npm install

jsonsp depends on [YAJL](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/) and the
[YAJL binding for Node.js](https://github.com/vibornoff/node-yajl).  libyajl
must be installed on your system prior to installing jsonsp.

Install YAJL via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac OS X:

    $ brew install yajl

## Usage

#### Initialize Parser

Create a new JSON stream parser.  The parser will incrementally parse data from
a stream, and emit an `'object'` event each time it parses a fully-formed JSON
object.

    var parser = new jsonsp.Parser();
    parser.on('object', function(obj) {
      // do something with obj
    });

#### Parse Data from Stream

As chunks of data are read from a stream, they can be incrementally parsed by
the JSON stream parser.

    var req = http.request(options, function(res) {
      // feed each chunk of data incrementally to the JSON stream parser
      res.on('data', function(chunk) {
        parser.parse(chunk.toString('utf8'));
      });
    });
